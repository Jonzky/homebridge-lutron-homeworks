# Homebridge Lutron Homeworks Plugin

This plugin intends to integrate HomeKit with Lutron Homeworks processors. It has been tested with QS but should work with any Homeworks systems. Currently only supports Homeworks processors but if there's enough interest it should't be difficult to expanded to other Lutron systems.

To install, please follow normal Homebridge install procedures, and use the config UI to add loads or dimmers to your system. 

This is a work in progress and we are currently releasing as Beta. Please open an issue to let me know on any problems you encounter.
